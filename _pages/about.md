Hi! My name is Zoe Yan. I am a data scientist and AI engineer in Porsche Digital, based in Berlin. My main focus is on building autonomous customer service using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, implementing **AI agents** for advanced customer interaction and support. Previously, I worked as a language data engineer in Nyonic, building and maintaining cloud-based databases for **LLMs pre-training** datasets. Additionally, I am also an indie hacker. I like to build full-stack web and mobile applications with **React JS** and **React Native** while integrating AI services.

Besides my work, I'm also an amateur photographer. I love to capture the essence of the world through lens. I also enjoy playing piano, tennis, reading, hiking and skiing. Those are things through which I seek to understand the patterns of the world, to find my own place in it. By connecting the learning process of each activity, I discovered the commonalities among them, and learned to stay focused and persistent. These traits are in return helping me to become a better engineer.

I love reading. Most of my readings are done on Kindle. But I found it hard to keep track of my Kindle highlights and notes. Many e-books do not support "Export Notes" feature, and those notes are stored in a txt file which is hard to read. So I built this app to organize my Kindle notes and make them easy to access.
