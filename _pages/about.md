Hi! My name is Zoe Yan. I am a data scientist and AI engineer in Porsche Digital, based in Berlin. My main focus is on building autonomous customer service using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, implementing **AI agents** for advanced customer interaction and support. Previously, I worked as a LLM data engineer in Nyonic, building and maintaining cloud-based databases for **LLMs pre-training**. Additionally, I am an indie hacker too. I build full-stack web and mobile applications with **React JS** and **React Native** while integrating AI services.

Besides my work, I'm also an amateur photographer. I love to capture the essence of the world through lens. I also enjoy playing piano, tennis, reading, hiking and skiing. Those are things through which I seek to understand the patterns of the world, to find my own place in it. By connecting the learning process of each activity, I discovered the commonalities among them, and learned to stay focused and persistent. These traits are in return helping me become a better engineer.

I am interested in building AI products and entrepreneurship. If you have any collaboration opportunities, please feel free to reach out to me. [Email](mailto:yanzengyu98@gmail.com)

**[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@zoezyn)**

I made a video explaining agent and its enterprise use cases in a simple and accessible way, from simple RAG to multi-agent systems.

This video is for people (new to AI) who want to have a better understanding of how AI agent is actually being implemented in real world applications. I combined my own experience and thoughts. Hopefully it can help people to have a better understanding of agentic systems.

**[Super Red](https://www.superred.dev)**

Finding real problems to solve can feel overwhelming. That’s why I built this tool—it analyzes Reddit discussions to uncover people’s biggest pain points around topics you care about.

Instead of guessing at problems or building solutions nobody wants, I wanted to start with real, validated frustrations. On Reddit, people openly complain about tools, ask for alternatives, and vent about unmet needs—these are goldmines for startup ideas.

This tool helps you cut through the noise and focus on problems that actually matter to real users.

**[Zindex](https://www.z-index.org/)**

I love reading. Most of my readings are done on Kindle. But I found it hard to keep track of my Kindle highlights and notes. Many e-books do not support "Export Notes" feature, and those notes are stored in a txt file which is hard to read. So I built this app to organize my Kindle notes and make them easy to access.

**[AutoLog](https://github.com/zoezyn/Hackathon-2025/tree/main)**

AutoLog is an autonomous system for auto-filing forms for logistics. Logistics and shipping companies manage thousands of forms daily, including custom declarations, import/export form, etc. In many cases, these forms are filled manually, which is error-prone (34% error rate in UK) and time-consuming. In the tech Berlin hackathon, me and my team built an agentic system that understands the form fields and company policies, and automatically send emails to related departments to get extra info and permission.
