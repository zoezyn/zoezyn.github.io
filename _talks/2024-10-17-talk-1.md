In this talk, I presented the commonly used AI workflows when building AI-driven applications, including prompt engineering, fine-tuning, RAG and AI agents. I discussed the pros and cons of each workflow, and how to choose the right one for different scenarios. Specifically, I focused on the concept of agentic workflows, and explained in detail how to build an agentic workflow for a autonomous application with concrete examples.
